# my-first-api-springboot
In this very simple project, I used some features of the Springboot framework, learned how to resolve dependencies & build a project using Gradle, and generated a docker image of the project using command line and uploaded it to my Docker Hub account (@miriamnunes).
It was interesting because I tried to run my Docker image in an ARM MacBook Pro and it couldn't build. I was puzzled, but after looking for the reason, I found a Docker article teaching how to make Docker images compatible with the new Apple ARM architecture. I followed the steps and it worked :)
